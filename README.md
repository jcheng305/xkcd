# XKCD RANDOM COMIC GENERATOR
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).



This is a XKCD random comic generator. (WIP)



# Instructions:
* Be sure to install a CORS plugin (compatible with most browsers), due to the reason that a CORS error occurs when using the API. You must use the plugin or else you have no access to the api.
* When user clicks on button it'll generate a random comic.



# Created with:
* Reactjs
* React-redux
* Redux-thunk
* Axios
* Redux
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
